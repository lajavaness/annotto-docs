# Why Annotto ?

Labeling is a key step to building and maintaining an AI solution. Its quality is essential for a successful AI. It requires mobilizing qualified resources for tedious tasks. It often leads to taking the data out of the organization which is often (poorly) outsourced.

## Quick Description

Annotto meets these challenges with two high value-added services:

1. An intelligent selection process for the data to be labelled:

Several AI and non-AI methods to isolate the most relevant data to label, in order to achieve high performance with the least possible labeling and obtain an unbiased AI by balancing the datasets.

2. Automatic pre-labelling:

Rather than labeling “from scratch”, the labeler validates or modifies the pre-positioned elements by an AI.

## The advantages of using Annotto

Annotto is:

- Reliable to avoid loss of annotations
- Intuitive and efficient (keyboard shortcuts)
- Collaborative (correction, comments, annotation guide…)
- And easily installable on-premise to avoid data leaks.
