# Annotation of a project: Segmentation

The **DEMO Segmentation** project makes it possible to annotate an image by delimiting areas.

In this example, we would like to locate on the image the part of the CV that deals with professional experience.

- We select our tool from the **_Tool_** section

- We also select **_Experience_** from **_Sections_**

- We delimit the corresponding area on the CV

The annotation is done instantly once you release the mouse click.

:::note
choice of annotation tool in order of appearance:

1. treats clearly identifiable areas

2. treats less uniform areas

3. personalizes selcetion relevant to the areas

:::

<video src={useBaseUrl('/video/screenrecord-1-5.mov')} controls width="100%"></video>

- To delete an annotation, just click on the X at the top-right of the selection.
