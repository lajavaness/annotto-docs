# Annotation of a project: Classification

The **DEMO: Image Classification** project allows you classify the item by specified categories.

In the following example, we browse images to determine whether they are administrative documents. This image does not represent an administrative document.

- I check the **_Other_** checkbox.

- You can also specify that the image was clear to annotate by checking the **_Yes_** checkbox in the **_readable_** category.

- Finally, we specify that the gender could not be identified by checking the box **_Other gender_**.

<video src={useBaseUrl('/video/screenrecord-1-4.mov')} controls width="100%"></video>

- Once the annotation is done, we save by clicking on **_Save & Next_**.
- To delete an annotation, just click on the X at the top-right of the selection.
