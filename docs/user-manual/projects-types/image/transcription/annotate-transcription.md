# Annotation of a project: Segmentation

The **DEMO: Image Transcription** project allows you to classify text from an image.

In the following example, we browse an image to extract its text.

- In the box **_text_** located on the right, we enter this text.

- Once the annotation is done, we save by clicking on **_Save & Next_**.

- You can also specify that the image was clear to annotate by checking the **_Yes_** box in the **_readable_** category.

- Finally, we specify that the sex could not be identified by checking the box **_Other gender_**.

<video src={useBaseUrl('/video/screenrecord-1-6.mov')} controls width="100%"></video>

- To delete an annotation, simply erase the content of the text box.
