# Annotation of a project: NER with relation

The **DEMO: NER with relation** project allows you classify the item by specified categories by creating a link between these categories.

In the example below, we determine a relationship between an experience and a skill.

1. First select the experience then the skill from **_Sections_**.

2. Then we will select the type of relationship under the heading **_Relations_**.

3. Finally, we click on the two entities to create the relationship.

<video src={useBaseUrl('/video/screenrecord-1-3.mov')} controls width="100%"></video>

- Once the annotation is done, we save by clicking on **_Save & Next_**.
- To delete an annotation, just click on the X at the top-right of the selection.
