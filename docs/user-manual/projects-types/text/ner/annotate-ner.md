# Annotation of a project: NER

The **DEMO: NER** project allows you classify the item by specified categories through two selection modes.

The **_Word_** mode allows you to select words.

In the example below, the type of contract is determined.

<video src={useBaseUrl('/video/screenrecord-1-1.mov')} controls width="100%"></video>

- Once the annotation is done, we save by clicking on **_Save & Next_**.
- To delete an annotation, just click on the X at the top-right of the selection.

The **_Character_** mode allows you to select a character or chain of characters.

In the example below, we determine how long the labor lasts.

<video src={useBaseUrl('/video/screenrecord-1-2.mov')} controls width="100%"></video>

- Once the annotation is done, we save by clicking on **_Save & Next_**.
- To delete an annotation, just click on the X at the top-right of the selection.
